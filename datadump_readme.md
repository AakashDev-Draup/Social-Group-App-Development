### Data dump

The data dump can be done by running the functions from the data dump module.
In the module go to the file dump.py and run the function one by one.

1. The sequence goes like this first make users say 15000.
2. Then make groups say 300 and select users and group such that users % groups == 0.
    so for this case 15000/300 gives 50 users in each group.
3. Then run the add user to group function which distributes all the users in these group
    equally.
4. Finally run the add post and comment function which makes a post and comment from each user.
